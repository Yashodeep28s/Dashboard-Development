Codtech Internship – Task 3: Dashboard Development using Power BI

This project is the third task of my Codtech internship, focusing on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard based on the analytical and predictive insights generated in previous tasks. The dashboard serves as a visual representation of the Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset, enabling business stakeholders to make quick, informed, and data-driven decisions.

The dataset contains millions of grocery orders with detailed product, department, aisle, and customer order history information. Using the processed and aggregated results from Tasks 1 and 2, the dashboard transforms complex datasets into easy-to-understand visuals.

The key objectives of the dashboard are:

Present order trends over time for better demand forecasting

Show top-selling products, aisles, and departments

Highlight customer purchasing patterns and reorder behavior

Visualize model prediction results from the machine learning task (likelihood of reorders)

Provide KPIs such as total orders, total customers, reorder rate, and average basket size

The development process includes:

Data Preparation – Exporting cleaned and feature-engineered datasets from Python/Dask to CSV format for Power BI integration.

Data Modeling – Establishing relationships between fact and dimension tables to enable accurate filtering and drill-downs.

Dashboard Design – Building interactive visuals such as bar charts, line graphs, tree maps, and slicers for real-time filtering.

Insights Presentation – Structuring the layout so that key business metrics are immediately visible, while deeper insights are accessible through drill-through pages.

This dashboard allows users to explore data dynamically, compare performance across categories, and identify actionable opportunities. By integrating big data analytics, predictive modeling, and business intelligence tools, it demonstrates the end-to-end process of transforming raw data into strategic business insights.
